# README

Description: This project was done with the aid of the video tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE. This is a mock Instagram website that allows a user to log in and post.

On this web application, we can register a profile, ![alt tag](/readmeImages/register.png), then log in, ![alt tag](/readmeImages/login.png), and start posting, ![alt tag](/readmeImages/newPost.png). After viewing the post, ![alt tag](/readmeImages/seePost.png), we can see all of our posts, ![alt tag](/readmeImages/seeAllPosts.png), before we log out, ![alt tag](/readmeImages/logout.png).

Extra Credit: I linked my face inbetween each button at the top. This was done by adding new li elements with attributes to the html and adding the image to /assets/images.
